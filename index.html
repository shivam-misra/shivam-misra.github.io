					<p>Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a third-year undergraduate student at UC Santa
						Barbara, studying Physics and Computer Science. My potpurri of interests include Computer

								<h4>Smart Security Systems</h4>
								<p style="font-size:1vw;">
									What started out as an excuse for a few friends to get together for a hackathon in
									SF turned into a whole (ad)venture for us. Smart Security Systems aims to solve the
									problem of archiving and making CCTV video footage queriable and provisionable,
									using Computer Vision techniques to tag videos into metadata. We won the Grand Prize
									at the Hackathon mentioned, and went on to present a MVP at the sponsoring company's
									headquarters in Berlin! You can check out our case study

								<h4>CrashMaps</h4>
								<p style="font-size:1vw;">CrashMaps is another hackathon project, but one that involves
									one of my favorite hobbies: cycling! CrashMaps provides a layer of safety for
									before, during, and after your ride, by
									connecting with a gyroscope component on your bike via an Android app to detect when
									crashes occur, contacting your emergency contact if needed.
									In addition, the location of your crash is logged an put into a heatmap on our web
									application, showing all the crashes in the recent area. This can be useful when
									planning rides or analyzing fixes
									in infrastructre for bicycle safety. You can check out the devpost <a
										href="https://devpost.com/software/crashmap-qbx23e">here</a>, and the project<a

								<h4>Science Olympiad at UCSB</h4>
								<p>I am quite fortunate to have had access to awesome STEM programs growing up in the
									Bay Area, one of them being Science Olympiad. Starting at UCSB, I realized many of
									the
									schools in the surrounding region did not have the same access to these programs,
									whether it was distance or availibility. My student organization hosts a tournament
									at UCSB every year for middle and high school students in the surrounding counties
									(Santa Barbara, Ventura, Kern, SLO), as we try to give
									back to the program that motivated so many of us to pursue STEM in the first place.
									You can check out more about the program <a
